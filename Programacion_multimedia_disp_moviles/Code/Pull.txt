Great question! Since you want to be able to pull future updates from the original repository while still committing to your own, here's the setup:
One-Time Setup: Add the Original Repo as "Upstream"
powershellgit remote add upstream https://github.com/meleiro/BetterTimeToSeeYou.git
Verify your remotes:
powershellgit remote -v
You should see:

origin → your repository (camilomontenegro/DAMFP)
upstream → the original repository (meleiro/BetterTimeToSeeYou)

How to Pull Future Updates
Whenever you want to get the latest changes from the original repository:
1. Make sure your local changes are committed:
powershellgit status
If you have uncommitted changes, commit them first or stash them.
2. Fetch updates from upstream:
powershellgit fetch upstream
3. Merge the updates into your branch:
powershellgit merge upstream/master
4. Resolve any conflicts (if there are any) - Android Studio has a great merge tool
5. Push the updates to YOUR repository:
powershellgit push origin main
Your Workflow Going Forward

Your daily work: git add, git commit, git push origin main (goes to YOUR repo)
Getting updates: Run the 5 steps above to pull from upstream and push to your repo

This way you can keep syncing with the original project while maintaining your own version!
